  <h2>Ingredients</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>400 g bomba rice</li>
    <li>1 kg chopped chicken</li>
    <li>500 g chopped rabbit</li>
    <li>200 g green beans</li>
    <li>100 g fresh lima beans</li>
    <li>100 g chopped tomato</li>
    <li>6 tablespoons of olive oil</li>
    <li>A few strands of saffron</li>
    <li>Ground red paprika</li>
    <li>A sprig of rosemary</li>
    <li>Salt</li>
  </ul>
  <h2>Steps</h2>
  <ol>
    <li>Pour the oil over the paella pan and turn on the heat. Once the oil is hot, add the rabbit and the chicken and fry until golden brown.</li>
    <li>Remember to turn the pieces of meat so that they cook evenly. Then, add the vegetables and sauté them.</li>
    <li>Now pour the grated tomato and sauté it in the same way, stirring constantly.</li>
    <li>Now it is the turn of the paprika. Add it and stir it just for a moment, then you have to pour the water up to the rivets of the paella to prevent it from burning. Add the saffron, the rosemary and the salt.</li>
    <li>Once the water comes to a boil, let it boil for about 5 minutes over high heat. Then, lower the heat to medium and let it cook for 20 to 30 minutes. Increase the heat and add the rice.</li>
    <li>The traditional way to put it is to make a cross in the boiling water and spread it evenly over the surface of the pot. Take advantage of this time to taste and correct the salt.</li>
    <li>Keep the fire high for about 10 minutes and reduce the fire to half for a similar time until the rice is cooked. Enjoy!</li>
