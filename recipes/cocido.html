  <h2>Description</h2>
  <p>This Spanish cocido hails from Madrid and is a hearty all-in-one meal, perfect for a chilly winter evening. Serve with bowls of noodle soup.</p>
  <h2>Ingredients</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>2 ½ cups dried chickpeas</li>
    <li>¾ pound beef shank</li>
    <li>¾ pound chicken thighs</li>
    <li>¾ pound pork belly</li>
    <li>2 (4 ounce) links chorizo sausage</li>
    <li>1 beef soup bones</li>
    <li>1 ham bone</li>
    <li>salt to taste</li>
    <li>6 cups cold water, or as needed</li>
    <li>½ medium head cabbage, thinly sliced</li>
    <li>4 tablespoons olive oil, or as needed</li>
    <li>2 cloves garlic, minced</li>
    <li>2 cloves garlic, chopped</li>
    <li>½ cup uncooked orzo pasta or other small pasta</li>
  </ul>
  <h2>Steps</h2>
  <ol>
    <li>Place chickpeas in a bowl and cover with plenty of cold water. Soak for at least 8 hours, or overnight. Drain.</li>
    <li>Combine beef shank, chicken thighs, pork belly, chorizo, beef bone, and ham bone in a pressure cooker. Cover with cold water and bring to a simmer uncovered. Skim off any foam that rises to the top.</li>
    <li>Add chickpeas and season with salt. Close cooker securely and place pressure regulator over the vent according to manufacturer's instructions. Heat until steam escapes in a steady flow and makes a whistling sound, about 5 minutes. Adjust temperature until regulator is gently rocking. Cook for 30 minutes.</li>
    <li>Meanwhile, bring a pot of salted water to a boil over medium-high heat. Add cabbage and simmer for 5 minutes. Strain and set aside.</li>
    <li>Heat olive oil in a skillet over medium-low heat and cook garlic until fragrant, about 1 minute. Add cabbage, season with salt, and cook until cabbage is tender, 5 to 10 minutes.</li>
    <li>When cook time for the meat is up, let pressure release naturally according to manufacturer's instructions, 5 to 10 minutes. Unlock lid and remove. Strain meat stock into a saucepan and bring to a boil. Add orzo to the boiling stock and cook, stirring occasionally until tender yet firm to the bite, about 11 minutes.</li>
    <li>Meanwhile, arrange the cooked meat on a serving platter surrounded by chickpeas. Serve with cabbage on the side.</li>
  </ol>
