## Checking my HTML knowledge

I’m going to build a basic recipe website. The website will consist of a main index page which will have links to a few recipes.

To this end, I will use the HTML tags I have learned so far. It won’t be pretty at first, but I will improve it once I’ve learned how to use CSS to add style to my web pages.
